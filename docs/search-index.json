[{"content":" This article is part of a series of blog posts aimed at developing ideas and vision defining the DNA of the Gharial project.\nThe first important set of software we saw on the Fediverse were mostly inspired by proprietary and successful online services. And today the global landscape of the Social Web is mostly driven by those mirrored services:\nMastodon: Twitter alternative Peertube: Youtube alternative Pixelfed: Instagram alternative Mobilizon: Meetup alternative Lemmy: Reddit alternative Bookwyrm: GoodReads alternative WriteFreely: Medium alternative And a lot of forks and similar projects.\nWhile it makes a lot of sense to take inspiration from what already works, making it FLOSS (Free Libre and Open-Source Software) and try to fix some issues during the process, we also should consider that doing so can also brings some unquestioned design flaws in its wake.\nEspecially when some of those flawed designs became \u0026ldquo;canonical\u0026rdquo; due to their wide adoption, leaving them even more unquestioned.\nAnother issue of duplicating some existing product is the lack of differentiation and originality of the proposal: by design, those new softwares already come into a field where there is already (at least) a well-established big player and therefore become a de facto competitor and prone to immediate comparison.\nOf course, duplicating existing services also have its merits and strength: there is no need to explain the new service to newcomers, and the adoption can be easier than something truly original and never experienced before.\nWhile I don’t thing the Fediverse followed the wrong path here, I also strongly believe that there is an unexploited potential that is currently unmet by the current landscape.\nBut first, let me unpack a bit more the previous claims I’ve made:\nProprietary software’s flaws and toxicity leaks into our work when we copy them While a lot of the current social media landscape’s toxicity is wildly documented and available out there (hell, there is even Netflix content about it!), I will focus in this section on the small things, the harmless and innocuous at-first-sight characteristics that we take for granted today and replicate without questioning them.\nThere would be a lot to cover here, but for the sake of the argument and food-for-though, I will use the case of social metrics as an illustration.\nSocial metrics seems to be a granted functionality those days: how much followers do you have, how much content did you post, how many likes, views, shares, your content generates, etcetera.\nOn a technical point of view, it surely is tempting to bring those metrics to the user interface. A single SQL request on preexisting data and here we go, a new nice and shiny gizmo to display!\nAnd having some numbers is always cool after all. It feels professional, it gives feedback and sense of control.\nUnfortunately, this is far from neutral and brings with its integration a whole set of behaviors and values.\nFirst, if applied to people, it ends characterizing them, consciously or not, numbers do have influence and impact.\nFor example, having a lot of followers can be seen as a social signal that you’re important, meaningful. That can change the way you behave, as much as how people interact with you.\nAnd that why we can see hoarding temptation and even massification seeking behavior based on those metrics. Some people will seek to increase those numbers and even work actively toward the sole mean of increasing it. On some platform, some might even buy those metrics to claim a social status.\nBut\u0026hellip; that’s not why we’re here, right? We’re here to share, to chat, to discover, to debate, to have fun, not to compete in a big numbers contest. How those metrics can be relevant in our space?\nOn proprietary platforms, this functionality makes a lot of sense: you need engagement to sell available human brain time to advertisers, and this kind of grind game incentivise your users to stay and even work for your service. People will try to engage on trending topics even if it doesn’t interest them for the sole reason of increasing their social metrics, will participate on viral conversations even if they despise the subject, and so on.\nBut on the open social web, where the focus of our work is toward the users themselves, is bringing those metrics in really a good idea?\nI’m convinced that we brought this functionality in because it was part of the original offering, and to create a \u0026ldquo;same thing but FLOSS\u0026rdquo; software, it just felt natural to keep it. Not because we strongly believe it was a good idea after a throughout and detached analysis.\nAnd maybe we should do a similar analysis on many other aspects that defines those proprietary platforms, especially when they’ve become usual and sometime even part for the local culture, and that it’s easy and tempting to import it without questioning it.\nFLOSS should be a mean, not an end As a developer myself, I understand the stance and temptation to label code as FLOSS and call it a day. But I think we should look forward the question of licensing.\nFirst because - and pardon my French here - people don’t give a fuck about licensing. And in a way they’re right about it. If a service gives an inferior experience compared to other alternatives, it’s a hard sell to justify its value only via its license, the end-user is mostly not a programmer and licensing doesn’t impact them much.\nI strongly think that the FLOSS conversation should be more of an explanation than anything else, that we should only speak about it when people question how we managed to provide the software/service itself. It’s a mean, not an end.\nFor example, in the case of Mastodon, it’s the claim that people can possess the tools of creating and managing their community that is guaranteed by FLOSS licensing, and we should always insist on the former than the later.\nOn this side, I also think the value provided by the current landscape is weaker than it could be, and it was illustrated by Meta’s Threads service entering the space: people were afraid of the impact of such service, and that they might end Embrace/Extend/Extinguish the Fediverse.\nIf we fear that an actor could perform such hostile operation, it just means that the value and experience of the Fediverse isn’t sufficiently anchored in what FLOSS can permit (sovereignty, interconnectivity, etc).\nThe best warranty of resilience we can obtain is by making sure that the first characteristic of the Fediverse is the access to all the compatible services and communities. That way we will ensure no-one will be able to takeover the space, since the way the space operates is the distinctive and inherent value.\nEven better: we should try to create services and software that couldn’t be replicate in the proprietary space, offering a user experience impossible to experiment with privative networks.\nHence bringing something truly original to the table and ensuring our independence and resilience.\nThe Open Social Web as a peaceful experience In the current “FOMO” and hyper-competitive space that BigTech’s service provides, there is a nice and easy way to fundamentally distinct the Open Social Web to make it more attractive: offering the opposite experience.\nIf we look back at the good old 2000’s web, people were following this path: checking blogs and websites to see if new content were published was tedious, so we invented RSS feeds, aggregators, etc. The idea was to remove pressure and make our life easier and less prone to FOMO.\nThat also explain why many of us didn’t understand the attractiveness of Facebook or Twitter as a RSS replacement at that time, since it reintegrated those bad aspects (but to be completely fair, it was only because RSS was only known and used by power users, we also failed on the vulgarisation field).\nAlso, being on the Fediverse since 2017, here is some observations I’ve made:\nI’ve never really seen newcomers being fond of the decentralized aspect: it increases the onboarding complexity with few advantages at first sight. But on the other hand, newcomers - after some time - are amazed by the more appeased and calm space the Fediverse is, and that’s what ultimately make them stay. \u0026ldquo;Big profiles\u0026rdquo; from other platforms usually come, applies their common posting habits to get traction (often by posting overly polarised and outraged content) that usually game positively the algorithm elsewhere, only to see that doesn’t work here and leave. These observations are interesting since it was very common to promote Mastodon as a Decentralized Twitter alternative, but decentralization is a necessary evil that degrades the newcomer’s onboarding, and people finally stay on the service because it’s not one of those services where you’re almost invisible if you don’t like surfing on the dopamine-boosted outraged bandwagons.\nIn fact, marketing Mastodon as a \u0026ldquo;\u0026ldquo;Peaceful Twitter\u0026rdquo;\u0026rdquo; (or something conveying the same idea) may have been more adequate, since the inner value of it is to not provide the toxicity and FOMO of the later. And the \u0026ldquo;explanation\u0026rdquo; on \u0026ldquo;how\u0026rdquo; Mastodon successfully manage to do this would be all the talking about decentralization, lack of toxic algorithm and so on (for those interested, and clearly, not everyone seems interested to learn about those details).\nSure, nothing’s perfect, and we do have our share of drama and so on, but those are way more natural and not actively promoted and rewarded by the system itself.\nAnd I’m convinced this is the way forward: we should continue working on how to increase the peacefulness of the space, how to make it more enjoyable, less time-consuming and more respectful of the end user’s attention.\nSure, doing so will not provide services as engaging and addicting as other’s Big Tech products, but that’s a feature, not a bug. And it should definitively be our end-goal.\nI aim to create Gharial with all those thoughts in mind.\nI would love to get your opinion and feedback; do you agree with this analysis?

The inefficiency of it can be describe in numerous ways:\nContent is short lived. Creating a Fear-Of-Missing-Out sentiment for the audience (if you’re not here, you’ll miss content you want to see, so don’t leave), and incentivising creators to split and spam content to extend the life of it, artificially increasing activity. Content isn’t organized nor structured (enough), to keep people busy tackling inefficiently inside the platform. Although they have the teams, the fundings, and had years of development, platforms are still unwilling to present you content in a way that doesn’t waste your time and is respectful of your attention. Even the few algorithms that are in place to redirect content toward their hypothetical audience, have proved themselves to be at least ineffective, at worst highly damageable and dangerous. Content must be reworked to fit properly the platform. To keep the walled garden closed to migration, high incentives had been put in place so that you host the content itself on the platform (making it unavailable from the outside), or strongly insensitive you to remix it under new forms (the platform’s Stories for example). All this leaded to new behaviors and functionalities over the years, as people changed and adapted to those incentives, and the platforms providing new tools to support those changes.\nTwitter’s Thead is maybe the best illustration of it. When I joined Twitter in 2009, its global feeling was - and I will quote one of my closest friends here - a \u0026ldquo;Personal RSS of people’s life\u0026rdquo;, where content was still hosted elsewhere and the Twitter posts were just a notification, with a link, a quick description, and a way to react and interact with. So, we posted a link to a blog post in a single tweet and that was it.\nBut due to the short-lived aspect of the tweets, people started to change the way of sharing blog post, by posting the article bits by bits, flooding the space so that it could stay a little longer visible to the potential audience. This practice had also some advantages as since the content was now hosted on the platform, it was now compatible with re-sharing it (retweet) easily, or even being compatible with other tools of the platform like commentaries on content (quote tweet). Making it even more long-lived and rewarding the original author with more visibility.\nThe visibility heist Once the platform and the users where trap into this constant flood of content, it became harder and harder to have access to an audience, especially if you didn’t want to capitulate to the diktat of the new ways to behave on the said networks.\nThey efficiently obfuscated the work of creators and artists so that they could made them work for them in exchange of some little bits of visibility they stole in the first place.\nThat’s why we started to see people trying to game the system to get at least some of the stolen visibility back.\nFor example, associations and groups hosting their activity on Facebook Groups started to ask their members to like and react on publications so that they could be send to a wider audience by the algorithm.\nAn audience that wasn’t even a new one, but the current one that already shown interest and subscribed to get updates and was actively kept in the dark by the platform.\nUnless you and your relatives invest time and work into the platform, of course.\nThe salesman’s transformation Since communicating and reaching an audience became more difficult and trickier, asking for more efforts and competence to be done effectively, people invested themselves into understanding those tools, focusing on metrics and what could influence them, trying to increase their control for a better efficiency.\nThat’s basically what marketers, salespeople and MBA holders are doing for a living.\nAnd that’s an issue:\nArtists and creators that do (understandably) accept that bad deal, must redirect time, work and sometime even money from their main activity. Sometime the incentives can even be so rough that it can even have an effect of the art itself, pushing the artist to distort their work to fit better the platform’s frame. Normalizing and sugarcoating it. Marketing and Art aren’t a good match. The first is people-pleaser while the second doesn’t have to. There are people-pleasing arts, but it’s a small part of the full spectrum of the field.And if you ask me, it’s not the most interesting one. Artists and creators that doesn’t want to take the deal are effectively muted.It’s not uncommon nowadays to see editors \u0026ldquo;\u0026quot;finding\u0026rdquo;\u0026quot; their new talents on the platforms, it’s effectively less risky for them since they target people that already managed to reach and gather an audience around them, but that also restrict considerably the wideness of sensibilities and personalities that can go through this selection process. It’s not because you don’t have a hypertrophied ego, or that you’re shy, or that you don’t have a marketing background, that you’re not someone interesting to be heard. In fact, it’s maybe even the exact opposite. Creators and Artists aren’t salespeople. Or shouldn’t they.\nWe should be more vocal about this fact, and start working against this trend.\nGharial This sentiment is what will lead my work in the Gharial project.\nI must admit it was difficult for me to choose the first article to write on this blog, deciding from which edge to start from, since it will be the foundation I will work from for the next articles.\nI hope it wasn’t too disjointed and will at least give a global idea of the path the project aims to follow.\nThis was a first glimpse of the problem, in the next blog posts I will dig and develop more related aspects of it, and will, of course, start talking of possible solutions.\nI would love to get your opinion and feedback, do you agree with this analysis?
