This is the first post of a hopefully long and interesting journey.

At first this place will feel quite empty, but I'll progressively develop and share my vision, from where I stand, to where I want to go and how.

All I can tell you so far is... my aim is to provide a new kind of Fediverse software, that will not try to mimic GAFAM's products, that will be community focused and will maybe solve some of the Fediverse's issues at the same time.

Ambitious? Well not that much, but who knows?

I'm also doing my first steps with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), so baby steps, I already broke the damn thing more than I can already admit.
